# Dan Lyons
## Software Developer

Hi I'm Dan, a Software Developer passionate about building scalable and distributed systems. Probably like you I have a constant stream of project ideas, some of which get started 
and either I don't have time to complete them or something else catches my attention.  


The goal of this blog is to post about my projects, lessons learned and hopefully complete more along the way.
